# Sample Applications

This page provides an overview of the sample applications available for Ocre-enabled devices. These samples demonstrate how to build and deploy applications using the Ocre platform, helping you get started with development quickly and efficiently.

---

## Available Samples
We offer *two* sample applications to help you understand and explore the capabilities of the Ocre platform:

1. **[Hello World](./hello-world):** A basic application that demonstrates the fundamental structure of an Ocre application and familiarizes you with the development environment.

2. **[Blinky](./blinky)**: An application that shows how to interact with device hardware by controlling an LED, introducing basic I/O operations on Ocre-enabled devices.

## Accessing the Samples

To access and work with the samples:

1. Ensure that you've set up your [Development Environment](../quickstart/first-app/dev-environment)

2. Navigate to the samples directory in your development environment:
    ```bash
    cd samples/
    ```
From here, you can explore each of the samples to get a feel for how Ocre containers are created.
