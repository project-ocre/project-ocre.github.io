# Prerequisites 

Before getting started with Ocre, you'll need a few key components ready to go. The runtime has specific hardware requirements to ensure optimal performance and functionality. We also require some basic development tools installed on your computer.

## Required Components

1. **Development Board** that meets ALL of the following:
  - Listed as a [supported board](../../board-support)
  - Network connectivity (built-in or via external module)
2. **USB Cable** compatible with your development board
3. **Computer** with:
  - **Operating System:** Windows, Mac, or Linux
  - The following **utilities** installed:
        - [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
        - A [Serial Console](../prerequisites/serial-console)

If your board isn't listed as supported but meets all of the mentioned requirements, board support can be added by following the [Adding Board Support](../../board-support/adding-support) guide.
