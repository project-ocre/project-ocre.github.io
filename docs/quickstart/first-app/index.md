# Your First App

This section guides you through creating your first containerized application with Ocre. You'll set up a development environment and build a simple application that demonstrates Ocre's core capabilities.

---

## Getting Started

Begin by following our [Setting Up Your Development Environment](./dev-environment) guide to install and configure the necessary tools. This guide offers two approaches:
- Using Visual Studio Code with Dev Containers for an integrated IDE experience
- Using Docker interactively for a command-line workflow

Once your environment is ready, proceed to [Building And Deploying Your First Container](./first-container) to continue with your first Ocre application.
