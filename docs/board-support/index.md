# Board Support
The Ocre runtime supports various development boards, each offering different features and capabilities. Each board's documentation provides:
- Hardware specifications and features
- Connection and setup instructions
- Flashing procedures
- Reset and recovery steps
- Relevant board documentation links

Select your boards manufacturer in the **sidebar** to the left, and subsequently your specific board for detailed setup and usage instructions for your board.
