# STMicroelectronics

STMicroelectronics development boards offer an excellent platform for working with the Ocre runtime. This section covers our currently supported ST boards and the recommended development tools for working with them.

## Required Tools
Before working with any STM32 board, you should install:
* **[STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html)**: Official programming utility required for flashing firmware and configuring STM32 devices.

## Optional
Some boards need other utilities and drivers to build and flash the Ocre runtime and can be found below.
* **[openocd driver](https://openocd.org/)**: Openocd is an open-source on chip debugger, and the default flashing utility for some ST boards. 

## Supported Boards
Select your board below for detailed setup and usage instructions.
