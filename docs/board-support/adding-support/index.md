# Adding Board Support
This guide outlines the process of adding support for new development boards to the Ocre runtime. While we aim to support a wide range of boards, the embedded ecosystem is vast, and you may need to add support for your specific hardware.

Adding support for a new board involves:
- Creating board-specific configurations
- Testing and validating Ocre runtime functionality
- Contributing your changes back to the project

Follow the steps below to begin adding support for your development board.
