## What to Contribute

To add official support for your board, you will need:
- Your board's overlay file 
- Your board's configuration file 
- Any additional documentation about board-specific requirements, such as:
  - Required hardware (modules, shields, adapters, etc.)
  - Wiring or connection diagrams
  - Special setup instructions
  - Hardware revisions supported
- (Optional) Update the [`ocre.code-workspace`](https://github.com/project-ocre/ocre-runtime/blob/main/ocre.code-workspace) file by adding your board name to the `board` input options in the "West Build" task.
