# Contributing to Ocre's Documentation

We welcome contributions to our documentation! This guide (still very mucah a WIP) will help you get started with the process.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork: `git@github.com:<your_username>/project-ocre.github.io.git`
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`

## Making Changes

1. Navigate to the `docs` folder and make your changes using your preferred text editor.
2. Test your changes locally by running `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the project root.

2. If not, create a new issue, providing as much detail as possible.

## Community Guidelines
