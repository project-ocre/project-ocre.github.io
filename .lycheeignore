# Enter each URL or pattern you wish to exclude on a separate line, employing regular expressions for targeted exclusions or glob-style patterns for broader matches.
# Reference: https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee?tab=readme-ov-file#ignoring-links

# NOTE: For file exclusions, please use ".lychee.toml"
#
# Usage:
# - Write full URLs to ignore specific links.
# - Use asterisks (*) as wildcards to match any number of characters.
